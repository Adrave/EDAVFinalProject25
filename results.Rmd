```{r}
# Get a list of files that match a certain pattern
files <- list.files(path="player-moves", pattern="*csv", full.names=TRUE, recursive=FALSE)

# Create an empty data frame to store the combined data

colnames(all_games) <- c('white_name', 'white_elo', 'black_name', 'black_elo', 'result', 'move_number', 'move')

First, lets take a look at each player's win rate with the white pieces.

```{r}
ratings <- all_games
ratings <- subset(ratings, move_number == 1)

# Get the number of rows in the data frame
num_rows <- nrow(ratings)

# Create a vector of ones with the same number of rows as the data frame
ones <- rep(1, num_rows)

# Add the vector of ones to the data frame as a new vicolumn
ratings_with_ones <- cbind(ratings, ones)


ggplot(data = ratings) +
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=white_name,fill=result))
```
