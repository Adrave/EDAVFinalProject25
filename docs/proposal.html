<p>In its modern form, the game of chess has existed for about 500 years. Modern
chess theory is built off the back of the giants over these past 500 years, and
more recently, a revolution through online chess engines. In the present day,
top chess players are able to study and memorize moves across the engine in
order to gain the slightest of edges in such a highly optimized game. In this
project, we will be exploring the popularity of different chess openings at the
top level throughout history, as well as their innovators, the chess world
champions and grand masters.</p>
<p>A game of chess can be broken down into three primary stages: the opening, the
middle game, and the end game. There aren’t clear boundaries between the
categories as the game transitions, but the opening is notably distinct: it is
the first stage where the players maneuver their pieces in an attempt to create
a positional advantage over their opponents, and the precise location of every
piece at the start of the opening phase is constant. Because there are so many
possible chess games, this initial phase of play is essential in determining
the remainder of the game. Roughly, the middle game involves battling the
opponent in a series of offensive and defensive moves, whereas the end game is
when players with better positions will typically win.</p>
<p>Moving from the game itself to its players, the chess grandmasters are the best
of the best. They have taken all three stages of the game and mastered them all.
Not only that, but chess was the staging ground for the ELO system, which has
had major ramifications over competitive sports the world over–in doing so,
chess organizations have had dutiful record keeping before the internet and
digital databases were ever conceptualized, so there is a thorough archive that
we can pull from in studying these players. Among the grandmasters there are the
world champions, the best of the best, and these pioneers’ track records are
especially vivid. Thus, to gain a better understanding of chess over time, we
will we will be analyzing the performance of select grandmasters and world
champions, and how their openings have evolved over the course of history.</p>

<p>The majority of our data will be pulled from <a href="chess.com">chess.com’s database</a>.
These are over-the-board chess games and not games that were played online.
When chess games are played, the players are required to write down the notation
and keep track of the moves that have been played. Chess.com stores this data,
and provides an openly-downloadable data record as follows:</p>
<p>[Event {Event Name}] <br>
[White {White Player Name}] <br>
[Black {Black Player Name}] <br>
[WhiteFideId {White FIDE ID}] <br>
[BlackFideId {Black FIDE ID}] <br>
[WhiteElo {White Elo Rating}] <br>
[BlackElo {Black Elo Rating}] <br>
[Result {Game Result}] <br>
[Round {Round of Tournament}] <br>
[TimeControl {Time Control}] <br>
[WhiteClock {White Clock Finish Time}] <br>
[BlackClock {Black Clock Finish Time}] <br></p>
<p>These appear to be exported as plaintexts. Some rows are not always present, and
there is additional information that is sometimes present, but we will primarily
be focusing on these features within the scope of the project.</p>
<p>Regarding when the database is updated: new records are inserted when new games
are played. We aren’t entirely certain how frequently they are inserted, but
there is some sort of time-series data here–frustratingly, the time feature
often corresponds to when an individual game’s data was archived, not when it
was originally played. Naturally, old games do not need to be updated unless
they have yet to be put into the database.</p>
<p>There is a very nice download button on each player’s page, allowing us to
freely download records of multiple games at once. That said, Each player has
multiple-to-many pages of worth games. Only one page of games can be downloaded
at a time, so a scraping tool will be used. Furthermore, in detailing each
player, there are a few more fields on the player’s page themselves we will
be scraping.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.chess.com/games/search?opening=&amp;openingId=&amp;p1=Magnus+Carlsen&amp;p2=&amp;mr=&amp;lsty=1&amp;year=&amp;lstMoves=1&amp;moves=&amp;fen=&amp;sort=">Here</a> is an example of a page for games where the current world champion,
Magnus Carlsen, played the white pieces.
<a href="https://www.chess.com/games/magnus-carlsen">This</a> is the database of his games,
and <a href="https://www.chess.com/players/magnus-carlsen">this</a> is a link to his player
profile</p>
<p>We will be looking at results of <a href="https://www.chess.com/article/view/world-chess-champions">all past classical world chess champions</a>.</p>
<p>We will also be looking at the <a href="https://www.chess.com/players">16 current best chess players</a>.</p>
<p>Note that Magnus Carlsen is represented in both the top 16 players, as well as
in the world chess champions list. We hope to use him as a metric to compare
top grandmasters to world champions, through a modern lens.</p>
<p>These games do not appear to be behind a paywall; it should be free for anyone
to download. If that changes however, we also have access to a paid account.</p>
<p>We will need to parse over the file and then create JSON file to represent a
table of the data. If the database is too large, a JSON file might be needed for
each player. Further data format exploration will take place later.</p>
