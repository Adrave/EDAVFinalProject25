Modern chess theory is built off the back of the giants over these past 500 years, and more recently, a revolution through online chess engines. In the present day, top chess players are able to study and memorize moves across the engine in order to gain the slightest of edges in such a highly optimized game. In this project, we will be exploring the popularity of different chess openings at the top level throughout history, as well as their innovators, the chess world champions and grand masters. A game of chess can be broken down into three primary stages: the opening, the middle game, and the end game. There aren’t clear boundaries between the categories as the game transitions, but the opening is notably distinct: it is the first stage where the players maneuver their pieces in an attempt to create a positional advantage over their opponents, and the precise location of every piece at the start of the opening phase is constant. Because there are so many possible chess games, this initial phase of play is essential in determining the remainder of the game. Roughly, the middle game involves battling the opponent in a series of offensive and defensive moves, whereas the end game is when players with better positions will typically win. Moving from the game itself to its players, the chess grandmasters are the best of the best. They have taken all three stages of the game and mastered them all. Not only that, but chess was the staging ground for the ELO system, which has had major ramifications over competitive sports the world over–in doing so, chess organizations have had dutiful record keeping before the internet and digital databases were ever conceptualized, so there is a thorough archive that we can pull from in studying these players. Among the grandmasters there are the world champions, the best of the best, and these pioneers’ track records are especially vivid. Thus, to gain a better understanding of chess over time, we will we will be analyzing the performance of select grandmasters and world champions, and how their openings have evolved over the course of history. 2.2 Data availability The majority of our data will be pulled from chess.com’s database. These are over-the-board chess games and not games that were played online. When chess games are played, the players are required to write down the notation and keep track of the moves that have been played. Chess.com stores this data, and provides an openly-downloadable data record as follows: [Event {Event Name}] [White {White Player Name}] [Black {Black Player Name}] [WhiteFideId {White FIDE ID}] [BlackFideId {Black FIDE ID}] [WhiteElo {White Elo Rating}] [BlackElo {Black Elo Rating}] [Result {Game Result}] [Round {Round of Tournament}] [TimeControl {Time Control}] [WhiteClock {White Clock Finish Time}] [BlackClock {Black Clock Finish Time}] These appear to be exported as plaintexts. Some rows are not always present, and there is additional information that is sometimes present, but we will primarily be focusing on these features within the scope of the project. Regarding when the database is updated: new records are inserted when new games are played. We aren’t entirely certain how frequently they are inserted, but there is some sort of time-series data here–frustratingly, the time feature often corresponds to when an individual game’s data was archived, not when it was originally played. Naturally, old games do not need to be updated unless they have yet to be put into the database. There is a very nice download button on each player’s page, allowing us to freely download records of multiple games at once. That said, Each player has multiple-to-many pages of worth games. Only one page of games can be downloaded at a time, so a scraping tool will be used. Furthermore, in detailing each player, there are a few more fields on the player’s page themselves we will be scraping. Here is an example of a page for games where the current world champion, Magnus Carlsen, played the white pieces. This is the database of his games, and this is a link to his player profile We will be looking at results of all past classical world chess champions. We will also be looking at the 16 current best chess players. Note that Magnus Carlsen is represented in both the top 16 players, as well as in the world chess champions list. We hope to use him as a metric to compare top grandmasters to world champions, through a modern lens. These games do not appear to be behind a paywall; it should be free for anyone to download. If that changes however, we also have access to a paid account. We will need to parse over the file and then create JSON file to represent a table of the data. If the database is too large, a JSON file might be needed for each player. Further data format exploration will take place later.
