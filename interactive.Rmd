The following visualization is for anyone who is not as familiar with the chess board layout. The popular opening moves are hovered over on the right hand side of the chess board, the squares corresponding to where the chess pieces are moving to light up. Another feature of the board is that if you hover over a square, it tells you what its letter and number are.
